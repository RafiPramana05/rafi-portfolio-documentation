# Soft Delete System Implementation

## Overview
The admin projects system now implements soft delete functionality, allowing data to be moved to trash instead of permanently deleted, with options to restore or permanently delete items.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
- Added `deleted_at` column to projects table via migration
- Updated Project model to use `SoftDeletes` trait
- Changed default database connection to MySQL

### 2. Controller Updates
- Modified `destroy()` method to use soft delete
- Added `trash()` method to display deleted items with statistics
- Added `restore()` method to restore soft deleted items
- Added `forceDelete()` method for permanent deletion

### 3. Route Updates
- Added trash management routes:
  - `GET /admin/projects/trash` - View trash page
  - `PATCH /admin/projects/restore/{id}` - Restore item
  - `DELETE /admin/projects/force-delete/{id}` - Permanent delete

### 4. View Updates
- Updated projects index page with Trash button
- Created comprehensive trash page with:
  - Statistics cards showing counts by type
  - Detailed table with restore/delete actions
  - Visual distinction for deleted items

### 5. User Experience Features
- Statistics dashboard showing:
  - Total deleted items
  - Count of deleted Projects
  - Count of deleted Experiences  
  - Count of deleted Organizations
- Individual restore buttons with undo icon
- Permanent delete buttons with X icon
- Confirmation dialogs for all actions
- Visual feedback and hover effects

## Database Structure
The system uses a single `projects` table with a `type` field to differentiate between:
- `project` - Regular projects
- `experience` - Work/volunteer experiences
- `organization` - Organizational memberships

## Button Icons
- Soft Delete: `fas fa-trash-alt` (trash can)
- Restore: `fas fa-undo` (undo arrow)
- Permanent Delete: `fas fa-times` (X mark)
- Trash Page: `fas fa-trash-restore` (restore icon)

## Security Features
- Authentication check on all admin routes
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Clear visual distinction between restore and permanent delete

## Visual Design
- Glass morphism design consistent with existing admin panel
- Color-coded statistics cards
- Responsive layout
- Hover effects and transitions
- Opacity reduction for deleted items in trash view
